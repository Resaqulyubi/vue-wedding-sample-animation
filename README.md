## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

   - Your app will be available at the configured domain

### Docker Image Details

The Docker configuration uses a multi-stage build process:

1. Build Stage:
   - Uses Node.js to build frontend assets
   - Compiles and optimizes all Vue.js components
   - Generates production-ready assets

2. Production Stage:
   - Uses PHP 8.2 with FPM on Alpine Linux
   - Includes Nginx as web server
   - Uses Supervisor for process management
   - Optimized for production performance
   - Includes caching and compression

### Production Optimizations

- Static file caching (30 days)
- Gzip compression for text files
- PHP OPcache enabled
- Optimized PHP-FPM configuration
- Nginx performance tuning
- Supervisor process management

### Monitoring and Logs

Access logs through Coolify's dashboard:
- Nginx access and error logs
- PHP-FPM logs
- Supervisor process logs

### Scaling

The Docker configuration is designed to be scalable:
- Stateless application design
- Optimized for container orchestration
- Ready for horizontal scaling

For any deployment issues, check the Coolify logs and ensure all environment variables are properly configured.
